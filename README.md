# Haskell Course

**This course is designed to teach students Haskell from zero to everything needed to work with Marlowe and Plutus.** The course itself doesn't contain content specific to Marlowe or Plutus. So, if you want to use it to learn Haskell for other purposes, you can! ðŸ˜ƒ

For a more detailed explanation, keep reading or watch the introduction video:

## How much should I study if I only want to use Marlowe/Plutus?

In the [outline](#what-well-cover) below, there are clear stopping points (for both Marlowe and Plutus) where we deem you to know enough Haskell to effectively use the technology.

## How to read/watch the lessons

To go through the interactive lessons, go to your chosen lesson's outline inside "[What we'll cover](#what-well-cover)" and click on the button that looks like this:

## To do the homework

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) account.
3. Click this button to create a remote dev environment: [![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rober-m/haskell-bootcamp)
4. Select the `code/HomeworkXX` folder with the homework you want to complete.
5. Follow the instructions inside the app/Main.hs file.

## What we'll cover

**This is a tentative outline. Changes can (and will) be made as we advance with the course and gather feedback from students.**

**If there are no buttons on a lesson, it means that it's not published yet.**
