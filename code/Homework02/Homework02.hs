-- Question 1
-- Add the type signatures for the functions below and then remove the comments and try to compile.

-- f1 x y z = x ** (y/z)

-- f2 x y z = sqrt (x/y - z)

-- f3 x y z = x:((show y) ++ z)

-- f4 x y z = [x > y] ++ [z]

-- f5 x y z = x == (y ++ z)

-- Question 2
-- Are really all variables in Haskell immutable? Try googling for the answer.


-- Question 3
-- Why should we define type signatures of functions? How can they help you? How can they help others?


-- Question 4
-- Why should you define type signatures for variables? How can they help you?


-- Question 5
-- Are there any functions in Haskell that let you transform one type to the other? Try googling for the answer.


-- Question 6
-- How would you write the prod function from our lesson so that it works for Int and Double? Does the code compile?


-- Question 7
-- Can you also define in Haskell list of lists? Did we showed any example of that? How would you access the inner
-- most elements?
