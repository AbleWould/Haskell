-- Question 1
-- Change the code of the function mySort the we wrote in the lesson so that it
-- will work as the actual sort function from the Data.List module. 


-- Question 2
-- Write a function that takes in an integer n, calculates the factorial n! and 
-- returns a string in the form of 1*2* ... *n = n! where n! is the actual result. 


-- Question 3
-- Write your own version of functions zip and zipWith. Use pattern matching.
-- zip takes in two lists and returns a list of tuple pairs. zipWith works similar
-- as zip just that it also takes in a function and applies it to the pair so that
-- it returns just a list of elements with the same type as the input lists.

-- zip [1..3] [3..1]
-- returns: [(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)]

-- zipWith (+) [1,2,3] [1,2,3]
-- returns: [2,4,6]
